        Find the longest substring with same letter after at most k character replacements.

        Uses sliding window technique with a hashmap to track character frequencies.
        For any valid window:
            window_length - count_of_most_frequent_char <= k

        This means we can replace the non-most-frequent characters (whose total count
        is window_length - max_freq) to match the most frequent character.

        Strategy:
        1. Maintain a sliding window and count characters using hashmap
        2. For each window, check if we can make all chars same using â‰¤ k replacements
        3. If invalid window, shrink from left. If valid, expand from right

        Time Complexity: O(n)
        - We traverse the string once with the right pointer
        - The left pointer never moves more than n positions total
        - max(char_count.values()) is O(1) since we only have uppercase letters (26 max)

        Space Complexity: O(1)
        - char_count hashmap stores at most 26 uppercase letters
        - All other variables use constant space
