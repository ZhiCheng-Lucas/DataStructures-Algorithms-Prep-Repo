# DataStructures-Algorithm-Prep
A personal repository documenting my daily journey through LeetCode problems.

Each question is divided into its separate Python file and contains a brief explanation of the question, my thoughts on the solution and explanation, as well as the expected time and space complexity, along with comments in the code.


General Info:

Stacks: 

Consider when:
Expression Evaluation and Parsing or just Evaluation.

1. Last-In-First-Out
2. State/History Tracking
3. Nested/Hierarchical 
    - A stack is ideal because it naturally tracks the "most recently opened" item
    - Expression Evaluation and Parsing can fall under this as expression has inherent nesting through parentheses, and the order of operations creates a natural hierarchy

Common use case include:
- Expression Evaluation and Parsing
- Depth-First Search (DFS) Implementation
- Call stack management


2-pointer:
When it is a SORTED array.

For 2pointer or sliding window, can consider trying a graph for better visualization of the problem.
